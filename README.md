# Web Portal for Secure Online Exams

## Overview

This web portal is designed to provide a secure and reliable platform for conducting online exams. It incorporates robust features to prevent cheating and ensure the integrity of the assessment process.

## Key Features

* **Fullscreen Enforcement:** Automatically forces the exam portal into fullscreen mode, preventing users from accessing other applications or windows.
* **Anti-Tab Switching:** Monitors and logs any attempts by the user to switch tabs or open new windows.
* **Copy and Right-Click Prevention:** Disables the ability to copy text and access the right-click context menu within the exam window.
* **Optional Webcam Recording:** Records the student's webcam feed for potential review, providing additional evidence of exam conduct.
* **Alert-Based Proctoring:** The proctor only needs to monitor the student when the system alerts for suspicious activity, reducing the workload.

## Benefits

* **Enhanced Security:** Prevents cheating by restricting access to external resources and monitoring student behavior.
* **Fair Assessment:** Ensures a level playing field for all students by preventing the use of unauthorized materials.
* **Reduced Proctoring Burden:** The alert-based system minimizes the need for constant proctoring, allowing for more efficient use of resources.
* **User-Friendly:** The web-based interface is accessible from various devices and operating systems, providing a convenient user experience.

## Technical Implementation

* **Web Development Framework:** Utilize a modern web development framework like React, Angular, or Vue.js for a scalable and maintainable codebase.
* **Security Measures:** Implement robust security measures, including input validation, output encoding, and protection against common web attacks.
* **Browser Extensions:** Consider developing browser extensions to enforce fullscreen mode and disable certain browser features.
* **WebRTC:** For webcam recording, leverage the WebRTC API to capture and stream video data.

## Future Enhancements

* **AI-Powered Monitoring:** Integrate artificial intelligence algorithms to analyze student behavior and detect suspicious patterns.
* **Adaptive Question Difficulty:** Adjust the difficulty of questions based on the student's performance to optimize the assessment experience.
* **Mobile Optimization:** Ensure the platform is fully compatible with mobile devices for flexible exam taking.
